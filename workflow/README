Requires Python 3.3 or later to run.
May run with earlier version of Python 3.
is halfway compatible with Python 2, but will probably require minor tweaks.

To setup, need blifJoin.py, blifTMR.py, partitioner(.exe), vpr(.exe) and abc(.exe) links from workflow to where they are located.
Use latest Mercurial version of abc, not the vtr version.
To setup, obtain the latest mercurial version of ABC from bitbucket, and a recent version of VTR.
Create a link in this folder (workflow) to the abc and vpr (in VTR) binaries.
Next create a link (or just copy the binary) for partitioner in this folder.

blifTMR triplicates, blifJoin joins.
main.py runs the entire process on one BLIF file, run ./main.py -h for commands.
Will likely only run successfully when you cd into this folder first (no path/from/somewhere/else/main.py).
generate.py will run main on a whole folder of files, dumps results to a specified file, and provides a nice progress display.
run.sh provides an example of calling generate.
